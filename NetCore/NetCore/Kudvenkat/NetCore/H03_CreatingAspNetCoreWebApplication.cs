            There are different types of project that we can create in VS.
            
            1. Empty - This is the basic project template and it only contains required files to create a project.
            
            2. Web Application - This template uses the new Razor pages for building web applications. We can think of it as a slimmer version of MVC framework.
            
            3. Web Application (Model-View-Controller) - This template will create a project with whole application including model, view, controller, wwwroot folder.
            
            4. Razor Class Library - We use this template to create a reusable Razor class Library. This project contains all the reusable user interface pieces like
               data model, page model, controllers, pages, razor view and view components. Any application that uses the Razor Class Library can override the views
               and pages it contains.
            
            5. API - It contains template to build an API. An API does not have any UI so it will only contain controller folder.
