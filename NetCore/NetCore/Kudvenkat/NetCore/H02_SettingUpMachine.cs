            Setting up machine for ASP.NET Core Development
            There are two pieces of software that we need to install to get our machine ready for .NET Core Development:
            1. An editor - VS, VS Code, Sublime, VIM, Atom or any other.
            2. .NET Core SDK (Software Development Kit)
            
            Difference between .NET Core SDK and .NET Core Runtime?
            SDK includes everything you need to build and run .NET Core application. It already includes the runtime as well. If you are installing .NET Core SDK
            then there is no need to separately install the Runtime.
            
            Runtime includes just the resources required to run existing .NET Core applications. As we need to run and build .NET Core applications so we need .NET 
            Core SDK.
